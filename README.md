# Academic-Calendar-Assistant

## Description

The Academic Calendar Assistant is a tool that helps students manage their academic and personal schedules. It can be used to track assignments, exams, class schedules, extracurricular activities, and personal appointments. 

The objective is to create a user-friendly, feature-rich student calendar web application that helps students organize their schedules and increase productivity. This app will allow students to create and manage events, set reminders, and view their schedules in daily, weekly, or monthly views. It will also integrate with other calendar applications, such as Google or outlook Calendar, to allow for easy synchronization and access across devices. 

The tool will include features for creation, management and customization. It will use an artificial intelligence NLP model to retrieve data related to active courses schedules from Brightspace and add them to the Outlook/Google calendars.
